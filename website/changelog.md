## Unreleased — CI Truth, Dashboard Auth & Durability (F056–F058)

### F056: CI Truth & Supply Chain

- **112 previously-invisible tests now run.** `testpaths` covered only `tests/`, and CI passed an explicit `pytest tests/` path on top of that. `a2a/cstp/tests/` (47 tests, all green) and `dashboard/tests/` (65 tests) were excluded from every CI run and from the reported coverage number. Total: 1329 → 1460 tests; coverage 78% → 82%
- **Dashboard tests were uncollectable, not merely excluded** — `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'auth'`. `dashboard/conftest.py` now puts the dashboard directory on `sys.path`, matching how the Dockerfile loads the app, so the suite exercises production's import wiring
- **`uv.lock` deleted.** It pinned the package at 0.7.0 (eight minor versions stale) and contained no entries at all for `rank-bm25`, `networkx`, or `cel-python` — three required core dependencies. `uv sync --locked` produced an environment where BM25 retrieval, the decision graph, and CEL guardrails all failed to import. Nothing consumed it; CI installs directly
- **Coverage floor** — `--cov-fail-under=80`
- **mypy runs in CI**, non-blocking: `--strict` reports 184 pre-existing errors across 29 files. The step makes the count visible per-PR so it can be ratcheted down
- **Dependabot, CodeQL, and Trivy container scanning added** — there was no dependency or static security scanning of any kind

### F057: Dashboard Authentication

- **Empty-password bypass closed.** `config.validate()` — the only check rejecting an unset `DASHBOARD_PASS` — ran in `main()`, but `dashboard/Dockerfile` runs `gunicorn app:app`, which imports the module and never calls `main()`. The guard did not execute in any containerized deployment. Enforcement moved to import time via `enforce_security_config()`, which raises rather than warns
- **Constant-time credential comparison** — `secrets.compare_digest` on both fields, both always evaluated so no timing signal remains. An empty configured password never matches, independent of the startup guard
- **Login throttling** — 10 failed attempts per client per 5 minutes, then `429`. Process-local, so under `gunicorn -w N` the effective cap is N times that. Behind a reverse proxy set `DASHBOARD_TRUSTED_PROXIES` to the hop count, otherwise every user shares the proxy's address as one throttle bucket and a single attacker locks everyone out. The header is ignored unless that variable is set — an unvalidated `X-Forwarded-For` would let a caller mint a fresh bucket per request and skip throttling entirely
- **Werkzeug debugger no longer default.** `app.run(debug=True)` on `0.0.0.0` is now `debug=False` on `127.0.0.1` unless `DASHBOARD_DEBUG` / `DASHBOARD_HOST` say otherwise. This path is dev-only — gunicorn never reached it — so this is defence in depth, not the fix
- **CORS denies by default.** `cors_origins` was `["*"]` with `allow_credentials=True`; Starlette reflects the caller's `Origin` in that combination, meaning any origin with credentials. The middleware is now installed only for a non-empty allow-list, and credentials are enabled only when that list has no wildcard

### F058: Durability

- **Graph persistence is atomic.** `save_edges_to_jsonl` opened the destination with mode `"w"`, truncating it before the first byte was written — a crash mid-write destroyed **every** persisted edge, not just the in-flight one. It now writes to a temp file in the same directory, fsyncs, and `os.replace()`s
- **`CSTP_STORAGE` defaults to `sqlite`.** The default was `yaml`, which has no WAL, no FTS5, and no concurrent-write protection — while the vector, graph, and BM25 subsystems all assume a queryable, crash-safe store underneath. `yaml` remains available as explicit opt-in and logs a startup warning
- **Storage settings from `--config` YAML are now honoured.** The factory only ever read env vars, so `Config.storage` was ignored. That was harmless while both defaulted to `yaml`; with the new default it would have silently switched an explicitly-YAML deployment to SQLite. Precedence is env → YAML config → default
- **`docker-compose.yml` sets `CSTP_DB_PATH` inside the persistent volume.** The default `data/decisions.db` resolves to `/app/data`, which is not mounted — decisions would have lived in the container layer and vanished on recreate
- **Multi-worker refused rather than silently broken.** `DeliberationTracker` keeps session state in a process-local dict, so `preAction` → `recordThought` → `ready` must land on one process. `CSTP_WORKERS > 1` now exits with an explanation instead of losing deliberation state on whichever requests hit the wrong worker

## v0.16.0 - Provenance, CEL Guardrails & Circuit Breakers
*Unreleased — merged to `main`*

Audit-grade decision provenance mapped to SR 11-7 and NIST AI RMF, CEL expression guardrails, circuit breakers, and the full-stack Docker demo.

### F055: Decision Provenance & Control Evidence

Five new JSON-RPC methods that turn CSTP's decision history into an artifact an auditor can accept. JSON-RPC only — no MCP tools.

- **Two-class evidence model** — `observed` (third-party events the agent does not control) and `attested` (first-party CSTP records). Coverage is reported **separately per class**; there is no blended percentage anywhere in the API, the JSON bundle, or the PDF
- **`cstp.ingestEvidence`** - ingest observed events (GitHub PR opens, reviews, approvals, merges) into a SHA-256 hash chain
- **`cstp.linkEvidence`** - correlate an existing CSTP decision to observed events, stored as attested evidence
- **`cstp.mapControls`** - run the YAML rules engine over stored evidence; returns per-class coverage, `insufficient_evidence` entries, and `attested_only_controls`
- **`cstp.exportEvidenceBundle`** - emit the full bundle as JSON, or PDF with the optional `pdf` extra
- **`cstp.verifyEvidenceChain`** - verify chain integrity; accepts `expected_head_hash` and falls back to the last bundle's head hash so tail truncation is detectable
- **Control frameworks** - hand-written YAML rules for SR 11-7 (Federal Reserve MRM), NIST AI RMF 1.0, and CSTP-attested. Mappings are deliberately not ML-inferred
- **Honest gaps** - where evidence does not support a control, the mapper emits `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` with a plain-English reason instead of stretching the mapping
- **Separate store** - SQLite WAL database at `PROVENANCE_DB` (default `~/.cstp/provenance.db`), independent of the decision store

### F055 Security Hardening

13 verified findings from the PR #193 review were resolved before merge:

- **Injective hash preimage** - preimage is now canonical JSON of all six fields (chain format version 2). The previous newline-delimited preimage allowed collisions on embedded newlines. **Breaking:** version 1 chains fail `verify_chain` and must be re-ingested
- **Hash chain race** - `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` plus explicit `seq` serializes concurrent writers
- **`db_path` RPC escape removed** - the service always uses the server-configured `PROVENANCE_DB`; callers can no longer redirect reads or writes to an arbitrary file
- **Evidence class isolation** - mapping rules only match events of their own class
- **Bot approvals fail closed** - MV-3 / MEASURE-2.5 require `actor_is_human`, CM-1 / MANAGE-1.1 require a human approval count above zero
- Plus seq validation on `linkEvidence`, checkpoint state-machine fixes, non-dict payload rejection, atomic batch ingest, and collision-resistant bundle filenames

### F054: CEL Expression Guardrails

- **CEL conditions** - guardrail `condition` accepts a [CEL](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) expression string or `{"cel": "..."}` alongside the legacy key/value form
- **Reaches `action.context.*`** - fixes the gap where MCP clients could not pass context, so category-specific rules like `require-architecture-review` no longer always block through MCP
- **Legacy auto-conversion** - existing key/value conditions are converted to CEL at evaluation time; no guardrail files need changing and no migration is required
- **Fails open** - an expression that fails to compile or raises at runtime is skipped and logged, never treated as a block
- **Compiled once** - programs are cached per expression string
- **New dependency** - `cel-python>=0.4,<1.0`, now a core dependency

### F030: Circuit Breaker Guardrails

- `cstp.listBreakers`, `cstp.getCircuitState`, `cstp.resetCircuit` and the `get_circuit_state` / `list_breakers` MCP tools
- Category-specific code-review and architecture-review guardrails replace the earlier broad production guard
- Guardrail `context` is now threaded through both the JSON-RPC and MCP check paths

### F051: Docker-Compose Full Stack Demo

- `demo/` brings up CSTP server, ChromaDB, dashboard, and a reference FORGE-protocol MCP agent
- `demo/seed_data.py` generates sample decisions

### Website

- New [Nous](/nous) agent landing page, linked from the top nav
- Mermaid removed from the VitePress build; diagrams are inline SVG

### Bug Fixes

- **F041** - `build_wisdom()` accepts an optional `now` parameter, removing wall-clock coupling that made the wisdom recency filter fail as fixture dates aged past the compaction threshold
- **Encoding correctness on non-UTF-8 hosts** - every text-mode file operation across `a2a/`, `src/`, `scripts/`, and the test suite now passes `encoding="utf-8"` explicitly. Previously these relied on the platform default, which is cp1252 on Windows: F055 control rules loaded with 10 of 20 entries as mojibake, putting garbled regulatory text into auditor-facing bundles, and decision YAML could round-trip through a mis-decode into storage. Linux CI is UTF-8 by default, so none of it was visible there. Ruff `PLW1514` is now enabled to stop the defect class recurring

### Packaging

- `cel-python` added to core dependencies
- New `pdf` extra (`reportlab>=4.0`) for F055 PDF bundles, included in `[all]`

## v0.15.0 - SQLite Storage & Performance
*February 21, 2026*

SQLite-backed storage with 8-42x performance gains, enriched search results, YAML auto-migration, and dashboard server-side integration.

### F050: SQLite Storage Layer
- **SQLite backend with WAL mode** - Full ACID compliance, concurrent reads, ~900 lines of battle-tested storage code
- **Normalized schema** - Separate tables for tags, reasons, bridge definitions, and deliberation traces
- **FTS5 full-text search** - Keyword search on decision text, context, and tags
- **Factory pattern** - `CSTP_STORAGE=sqlite` env var switches backend; `CSTP_DB_PATH` for file location
- **Abstract `DecisionStore` ABC** - Clean interface for future storage backends

### Auto-Migration
- **YAML → SQLite migration on startup** - Automatic, safe, uses upserts (re-runnable)
- **Standalone migration script** - `scripts/migrate_yaml_to_sqlite.py` with 17 tests
- **Zero data loss** - All fields preserved including bridge definitions, tags, reasons, and project context

### Performance
- **queryDecisions: 0.37s** (was 3.16s with YAML — **8.5x faster**)
- **getCalibration: 0.06s** (was 2.54s — **42x faster**)
- **getDecision: 5.8ms** (was 27ms — **4.7x faster**)
- **listDecisions: 6.7ms**, getStats: 8ms

### Enriched Search
- **Bridge in search results** - `DecisionSummary` now includes structure/function bridge definitions (~200 bytes each)
- **Enriched pre_action** - Relevant decisions include outcome, reasons, and lessons learned
- **Deliberation on-demand** - Full traces (2-5KB) only via `getDecision`, not in list results

### Dashboard Integration
- **Server-side filtering** - Dashboard wired to `listDecisions`/`getStats` APIs instead of client-side YAML scanning
- **Decision detail page** - Full text, recorded_by attribution, strength bars, graph neighbor links
- **Calibration service refactored** - Uses `DecisionStore.list()` instead of YAML file globbing

### Bug Fixes
- Fix `dict`-type `project` field handling in SQLite storage
- Fix `reindex_decisions()` to delegate to `reindex_decision()` for full metadata rebuild
- Fix deliberation tracking in `pre_action` for MCP visibility
- Fix `safe_auto_link()` in `pre_action` auto_record path

## v0.14.0 - Multi-Agent Isolation & Live Deliberation
*February 16, 2026*

Multi-agent deliberation isolation, live deliberation viewer dashboard, memory compaction, decision graph with auto-linking, and quality enforcement.

### Multi-Agent Deliberation Isolation
- **Composite tracker keys** - `agent:{id}:decision:{id}` scoping prevents thought cross-contamination when multiple agents share an MCP connection
- **`agent_id` on all MCP tools** - `pre_action`, `get_session_context`, `ready`, `record_thought`, `log_decision` all accept `agent_id` for attribution and isolation
- **`decision_id` scoping** - `record_thought` and `log_decision` accept `decision_id` to scope deliberation consumption to specific decisions
- **`cstp.debugTracker`** - Live inspection endpoint for in-memory deliberation state

### F049: Live Deliberation Viewer
- New `/deliberation` dashboard page with real-time tracker state
- Session cards organized by composite key with agent/decision badges
- HTMX auto-refresh (5s) with Alpine.js expand state preservation
- Color-coded by age (fresh/stale), type badges for input sources
- Composite key parsing links decision IDs to detail pages

### F041: Memory Compaction
- Semantic decay: full → summary → digest → wisdom compaction levels
- `cstp.getCompacted` and `cstp.getWisdom` endpoints
- Wisdom and compacted results integrated into `get_session_context`
- Automatic compaction on startup and on review

### F044: Agent Work Discovery
- `cstp.ready` endpoint surfaces prioritized cognitive actions
- Action types: overdue reviews, calibration drift, stale decisions
- Filter by priority, type, category

### F045: Decision Graph Storage Layer
- `cstp.linkDecisions` - typed edges (`relates_to`, `supersedes`, `depends_on`)
- `cstp.getGraph` - subgraph queries with depth and edge type filters
- `cstp.getNeighbors` - lightweight neighbor queries
- Auto-linking on `recordDecision` from related decisions
- JSONL persistence, NetworkX backend, thread-safe

### F048: Multi-Vector-DB Support
- `VectorStore` and `EmbeddingProvider` abstractions
- ChromaDB and MemoryStore backends
- Factory pattern with `VECTOR_BACKEND` env var

### Quality & Process
- **`low-quality-recording` guardrail upgraded to block** - Decisions missing tags, pattern, or reasons are now rejected
- **`log_decision` demoted to last resort** - `pre_action(auto_record: true)` is the primary recording path
- **14+ MCP tools** (3 PRIMARY: `pre_action`, `get_session_context`, `ready`)

### Documentation
- Updated all docs with correct MCP flow: `pre_action` → `record_thought` → `update_decision`
- Multi-agent isolation guide
- Agent system prompt templates updated
- All 33+ feature specs on website

### No Breaking Changes
All features are additive. `agent_id` defaults to `"mcp-client"` when not provided. Existing clients work unchanged.
